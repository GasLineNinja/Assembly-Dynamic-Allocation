# Assembly-Dynamic-Allocation

#	Data Structure: [itemName (16 byte string), itemPrice (single), itemCount (integer)]
#
#	The program dynamically allocates an array of data structures and
#	asks the user for input to fill it. 
#
#	The data structure will print to the console and do the following:
#		->Calculate the sum and average of all items
#		->Find the items that have the min value and max value
#		->Finally, main will print out the sum, average, and information
#			(name, price, count) of the min and max item values
